**Note**:

This shell script **deploy-rsyslog-viewer.sh** is used to deploy loganalyzer to 
display rsyslog log data which is in MySQL database.

Architecture as following:
> user --> loganalyzer(httpd & php) container --> MySQL container <-- rsyslog server 
> rsyslog client --> rsyslog server
    
In this case, rsyslog server, loganalyzer container and MySQL container have been 
deployed at the same node(AIO).

You should prepare **Quay v3.3.0** or other registry in your environment, or load 
associated container image on the node.

Also you can use this script to deploy on the different nodes.

If use this script in other environment, please replace as followings:
- variables
- yum repository
  > Please pay attention to podman version.
- container image tag
- prefix of all container images: **quay.io/alberthua/{container_name}:[tag]**
